Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/ArmanAttaran/Supplemenetary_data_files_automation/tree/210b49ed0b3c4d44dcc39897d849785fb0560c95" target="_blank">210b49e</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>

    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    code/Construction/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  DELETE.jpeg

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/Provincial_view.rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/Provincial_view.html</code>) files.

<h2>set up</h2>
<p>in this section I will set up the foundation for the program; it is broke up into 3 parts; package dependency and path; functions,and finally code lists.</p>
<div id="package-dependency" class="section level3">
<h3>Package dependency</h3>
<p>in this section I will manage dependencies ( the packages used in this project; in R you need to state what you will use (kinda) and here we will simply state them) these will have to be installed for the program to run properly. if you run this in the cloud the commands below should be sufficient. if you uncomment the first 5 lines</p>
</div>
<div id="paths" class="section level3">
<h3>paths</h3>
<p>all the files in this program will now be created relative to where you run this script; it will create all the necessary subflorder and files from the location below</p>
<pre class="r"><code>here()</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;C:/Users/Arman/Documents/Statcan/R_projects/Supplemenetary_data_files_automation_v2&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="codelists" class="section level3">
<h3>codelists</h3>
<p>stating what the code lists are for the project to sort and query data from; if you want to add some thing for the table to include you can simple add it here and it should work;. it is designed this way to make this program more extendable, and maintainable. the added complexity is worth it</p>
</div>
<div id="table-numbers" class="section level3">
<h3>table numbers</h3>
<p>if you have any tables to add please add it here; it will make it easier to maintain this program</p>
</div>
<div id="functions" class="section level3">
<h3>functions</h3>
<p>here I will describe the functions required in the project. the most important one is the one for creating interactive tables in the browser that allow you to change which columns to show and to search through tables.</p>
<p>it is important for the search function and performance for the columns to be categories and/or numerics.</p>
